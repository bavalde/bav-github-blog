It´s summer and I have some free time so starting a new github blog. Yay! Slightly scary as I have 
never used github (or git) for anything serious before - I use svn and mercurial at work.
Anyways, how hard can it be? So let´s dive in.

So far I´ve:

- Found a theme that looked nice from Michael Rose (thanks!), see https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/
- Following the instructions I have forked and renamed the repo as https://github.com/bavalde/bav-github-blog.git
- I must have made a mistake when deleting and then creating a new gh-branch (idea was to start
with a clean working copy) because git started barfing at me so I did a hard reset origin -> gh-pages. 
- getting Jekyll and friends installed and working was very easy: "sudo gem install bundler" followed 
by "bundle install" and as far as I can see it´s just working.
- I´m writing this on a farily recent osX upgraded Mac, but github claimed my git was old so I grabbed a new 
git from https://git-scm.com/. Seems strange, but whatever, I´m fine with that if you need me to.
- This was all done in a few minuttes (ecluding reading/understanding time) and to build and view the sample site is 
as easy as "jekyll build" and/or "jekyll serve". 
- I´m not into serious vim (so far I have only learned enough vim to do basic editing when required). I guess an editor
with git integration would be nice and I´m trying out Microsofts "code" - looks nice so far. 
- The site/blog as such needs a major cleanup, currently there are many demo posts and leftovers from the
repo I cloned but the basics seems to be up and running.

Basically, this was faster and easier than I could have imaged. I´m impressed with the Jekyll and ruby/gem utils
and to me the theme from Michael Rose looks pretty slick.

Now I´m going the eat the macrell. What a booring fish and it´s all over the place for the time beeing. 
I wich it was a proper cod or something.
